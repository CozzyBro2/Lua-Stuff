Gato Troll plugin!

The ultimate plugin for consistent work :trollcat:

Who doesn't want a floating gato to talk about their code? I know I would.

Why should i use Gato Troll plugin? Here's why:

- Motivational! Gato is expressive and will encourage you to keep up the good work.
- Unique! No other plugin offers you gato troll himself, features emotes from the iconic (not really lol) scripted car server!
- Watch him float! Troll gato entertains himself while you code by floating around in a totally-not-repitive sine wave!
- :trollcatFlushed:, :trollcatHot:, :trollcat:, :trollcatDumb:, Do I need to say more?
